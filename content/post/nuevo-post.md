The culture of the Dominican Republic in terms of its people and customs is nourished by the mixture of Spanish, African and Taino roots. The Dominican Republic of this was the first Spanish colony in the New World. Certain diseases brought by the Spanish colonizers that were unknown to the native inhabitants practically eliminated the majority of the Taino Indians of the island; So the colonizers import large quantities of African slaves to replace the natives. After the Haitian liberation of the whole island, slavery was abolished and free blacks (and those with mixed races) spread throughout the islands.
