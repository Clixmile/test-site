Inhabited by Tainos since the seventh century, the territory of the country was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 becoming the site of the first European settlement in America, named as Santo Domingo, current capital of the country and first capital of Spain in the New World. After three centuries of Spanish domination, the country reached its first independence in 1821 but was quickly taken over by Haiti in 1822.
